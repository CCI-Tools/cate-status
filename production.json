  "message": "Dear cate users, the cci toolbox is about to enter its next evolutionary phase. It will become a python package esa-climate-toolbox that comprises access to cci data and offers operations to work on the data. It will be available from conda-forge, github and pypi. You can run this package in your custom environment. This change brings with it that the cate service will be shut down. We kindly ask you to backup any work that you have stored on cate's cloud storage and do not want to be deleted before the 6th of July 2023. Thank you for using cate, the CCI toolbox team"
